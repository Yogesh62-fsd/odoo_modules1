NOTE:

If a menu item points to a model to which a user doesnâ€™t have access and
has no submenus which the user can see, the menu will not be displayed.


Access rights can grant access to an entire model but often we need to be more specific:
 while an agent can interact with properties in general we may not want them
 to update or even see properties managed by one of their colleagues.
